In order to make it work, you need to:
  - Add the bot to your server
  - Go to the channel you want the bot to send PR updates to
  - Add the repo to the bot using \`/repo add\`
  - Optionally tell each user on the team to add their github username to the bot using \`/user add\`
  - Go to your github repo settings and a webhook with content type \`json\` selecting **only** Pull requests events and point it to ${process.env.SERVER_URL}/webhook/pr
  - Done!
